BioGrakn COVID is an open source project to build a knowledge graph to enable research in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19.

BioGrakn COVID provides an intuitive way to query interconnected and heterogeneous biomedical data in one single place. The schema that models the underlying knowledge graph alongside the descriptive query language, Graql, makes writing complex queries an extremely straightforward and intuitive process. Furthermore, the automated reasoning capability of Grakn, allows BioGrakn to become an intelligent database of biomedical data that infers implicit knowledge based on the explicitly stored data. BioGrakn can understand biological facts, infer based on new findings and enforce research constraints, all at query (run) time.
